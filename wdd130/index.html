             Some of my favorite hobbies are playing the piano, watching sports and taking walks.

            Currently I am not married but looking forward to do so soon.BYU Idaho is such a wonderful school, I
            love it so much because it integrates secular learning with spiritual learning.
            I have been a member of the church for a very long time. I was baptized on the 18th of April 2004 so its almost
             19 years now.I love the gospel so much and being a member means so much to me. 
             I have received so many blessings and my life has been abundantly blessed.
